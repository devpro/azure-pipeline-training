# Azure DevOps training material

Welcome to this training space!

You'll find here exercises to learn & practice [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/), the pipeline engine of Azure DevOps, ALM platform provided by Microsoft.

Feel free to contribute to this repository, by sharing it, raising issues and creating Pull Requests!

The knowledge you'll gather here will help you get better at CI tools in general. YAML definitions is the standard and if you are able to work with Azure Pipelines you won't be lost with other tools such as GitLab, GitHub actions, Travis, CircleCI and other recent tools.

## Requirements

### Azure DevOps account

You'll need access to an Azure DevOps project with permissions to create pipelines.

You can create a organization for free at this address: [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com/). All you need is an account registered in Microsoft, which can be made from a non-Microsoft email adress (gmail or yahoo for example).

### Software

* You can create & edit pipelines directly in Azure DevOps web UI but it can be nice to also edit the yaml files locally on your workstation. In that case, it is recommended to use an IDE such as **Visual Studio Code** (with extensions such as `EditorConfig for VS Code` by EditorConfig, `YAML` by Red Hat).

* You can be more efficient with the right **git client**, such as GitKraken.

* For .NET code, it will be more convenient to work with **Visual Studio 2019** if you're on Windows (or JetBrains Rider if you're on Linux or Mac).

## Tips

* [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops) is well made, this is the first place to look at to know what do to.

* Use intensively the online editor assistant (when you create or edit a YAML build pipeline), it's the best way to get up to speed quickly.

* Take some time to get familiar with YAML, and remember indentation is key!
